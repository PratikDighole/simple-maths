If you wish to contribute a function, please add a docstring as a description of the function.
The docstring does not need to be in-depth, but should give a quick idea of what the function does.
The more complex the function, the bigger the docstring should naturally be.
If possible, try also to keep the return statement clean, so that it is somewhat easy to see what is returned.
Please keep this in mind when making pull-requests.

The project uses 4 spaces and not tabs. It also, as a general rule, uses 2 newlines between functions.

As a student, my commit-speed may be somewhat unstable, but I will try to get through PRs as they come in.
